# X-O game
- This is a simple command line implementation of the classic TicTacToe game. The board is enoced in a single 18 bit bitset where every 2 bits is a cell with a state of Empty, X, or O. The winning patterns are also encoded in 18 bit bitsets. 
- The Game features a simple AI using MinMax algorithm.
  - The AI has 5 difficulties with 3 and above almost being impossible to win against
## Installing and running
### Requirements
- A C++ compiler
- Makefile
### Helpful commands
- `make XOEAI` : to compile and run the game
  - `make runXOEAI` : to run the compiled game again
- `make test`: to compile and run the test suite
  - `make runTest`: to run the compiled test suit program again
- `make clean`: to delete the generated executables
## Note
- Previously I was going to develop a handful of AI models on top of this game for learning purposes. At the end, I chose to implment only 1 here and the others for more complex projects where the benefits of each model would be best showcased.
- Maybe I will add a graphical application version in the future but for now this is sufficient.
